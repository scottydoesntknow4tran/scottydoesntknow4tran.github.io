        <p>
            In highschool sports were a big part of my life and helped make me into the perseverant worker that I am today. I was a 3 sport varsity athelete in the 4A KingCo confrence, the hardest confrence in WA. 
            I did football, baseball, wrestling, and track. I earned 9 scholar athelete awards for keeping my GPA above 3.5 while completing a sport season. Sport in highschool has made me into a 
            person who will do anything for the team and a feirce competitor. <br>
            I acheive the rank of Eagle Scout over the course of 6 years. My eagle project was paint a United States and world map on the concrete at the entrance of my elementary school. Both maps were rough 30ft x 30ft, 
            required stencils, and organization of a large team. Completing this project was one of my proudest moments in highschool and I will carry it withe me forever.

        <h3>
            History with Computer Science
        </h3>
        <p>
            My first expirence programming was in 8th grade. It was a few basic lessons in scratch and I quite enjoyed it. This led me to take Intro to CS and Intro to game desing freshman year of HS.
            I explored more scratch and learned python. Both of these classes were not challenging or intresting enough, so I did not take AP CS and did not look to learn more programming in HS.
            I entered Gonzaga as an EE major (Electrical Engineering). I took my first college CS class sophmore year and switched to Computer Engineering (CE) with minors in CS and Applied Math.
            Obvisouly I relized that a loved CS and wanted to do more and more of it with each class I took. CE is the cross between EE and CS, so it allows me to learn the fundamental of both,
            and focus on the area I want to specialize in. I think you can guess which. I am glad to still have the EE classes and the Applied Math minor because they require a high level of math 
            which I feel is imperative for any engineer and I really enjoy learning. The EE classes have given me an deeper understading of computers from the npn transistors that make up the logic gates, that make up registers, 
            that make up caches and memory.
