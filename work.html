        <p>
            I have had 5 different jobs so far. I umpired baseball in highschool. This job taught me how to be in charge of players, coaches, and parents all at the same time. I started in retail at Target for short time before moving to The Home Depot. 
            I worked at Amazon for for one summer and learned that overnight wharehouse work was not for me. I much more enjoy the customer facing part of retail.
            I currently work as a Customer Service and Deliveries Associate at The Home Depot. I work at The Home Depot during Summer and Winter breaks and TA while at school. 
            Every job I have had has taught be something valuable. Such as workplace relationships, work habits, and how to work 40-60 hours a week. I have truly come to enjoy working at 
            The Home Depot because of the people I work with. I am very happy to start my career with the Software Engineering internship with The Home Depot HQ, but I will miss the people I currently work with.
