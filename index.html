        I am an computer engineer at Gonzaga University in Spokane, WA.<br>
        I love programming and working on anything that pushes the neeedle.<br>
        I have recently secured a SWE(software engineering) internship with The Home Depot for next summer<br>
        I have worked at The Home Depot for the last 2 years and enjoyed every part of it.

        In highschool sports were a big part of my life and helped make me into the perseverant worker that I am today. I was a 3 sport varsity athelete in the 4A KingCo confrence, the hardest confrence in WA. 
        <br>I did football, baseball, wrestling, and track. I earned 9 scholar athelete awards for keeping my GPA above 3.5 while completing a sport season. This work in highschool has made me into a <br>
        person who will do anything for the team, and a competitor.<br>

    <h5>
        History with Computer Science:
    </h5>
    <p>
        My first expirence programming was in 8th grade. It was a few basic lessons in scratch and I quite enjoyed it. This led me to take Intro to CS and Intro to game desing freshman year of HS. <br>
        I explored more scratch and learned python.  Both of these classes were not challenging or intresting enough, so I did not take AP CS and did not look to learn more programming in HS.<br>

        I have had 4 different jobs so far. In the past umpired baseball in highschool and worked at Target. <br>
        Currently I work at The Home Depot during breaks and TA while at school. Every job I have had has taught be something valuable. <br>
