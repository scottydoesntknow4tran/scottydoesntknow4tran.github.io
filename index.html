        I am an computer engineer at Gonzaga University in Spokane, WA. I love programming and working on anything that pushes the neeedle.
        My favorite pastimes are playing sports of any kind, fantasy football, using my home gym, making homebrews, and working on my old 1995 ford ranger. (just to keep it running)
        I have recently secured a SWE(software engineering) internship with The Home Depot for next summer. I have worked at The Home Depot for the last 2 years and enjoyed every part of it.
        This is a big step in my career. I hope to learn as much as I possibly can and prepare myself for my future as a computer engineer.

    <p>
        In highschool sports were a big part of my life and helped make me into the perseverant worker that I am today. I was a 3 sport varsity athelete in the 4A KingCo confrence, the hardest confrence in WA. 
        I did football, baseball, wrestling, and track. I earned 9 scholar athelete awards for keeping my GPA above 3.5 while completing a sport season. Sport in highschool has made me into a <br>
        person who will do anything for the team and a feirce competitor. <br>
        I acheive the rank of Eagle Scout over the course of 6 years. My eagle project was paint a United States and world map on the concrete at the entrance of my elementary school. Both maps were rough 30ft x 30ft, 
        required stencils, and organization of a large team. Completing this project was one of my proudest moments in highschool and I will carry it withe me forever.

    <h3>
        History with Computer Science:
    </h3>
    <p>
        My first expirence programming was in 8th grade. It was a few basic lessons in scratch and I quite enjoyed it. This led me to take Intro to CS and Intro to game desing freshman year of HS.
        I explored more scratch and learned python. Both of these classes were not challenging or intresting enough, so I did not take AP CS and did not look to learn more programming in HS.
        I entered Gonzaga as an EE major (Electrical Engineering). I took my first college CS class sophmore year and switched to Computer Engineering (CE) with minors in CS and Applied Math.
        Obvisouly I relized that a loved CS and wanted to do more and more of it with each class I took. CE is the cross between EE and CS, so it allows me to learn the fundamental of both,
        and focus on the area I want to specialize in. I think you can guess which. I am glad to still have the EE classes and the Applied Math minor because they require a high level of math 
        which I feel is imperative for any engineer and I really enjoy learning. The EE classes have given me an deeper understading of computers from the npn transistors that make up the logic gates, that make up registers, 
        that make up caches and memory.

    <p>
        I have had 4 different jobs so far. In the past umpired baseball in highschool and worked at Target. Currently, I work at The Home Depot during breaks and TA while at school. 
        Every job I have had has taught be something valuable. Such as workplace relationships, work habits, and how to work 40-60 hours a week.

    <p>
        I have completed a few different projects for school and for fun, including this one!<br> <br>

        This Project:<br> <br> 

        I set up a Github repository and used Github pages to host a static website. I used the Github student developer pack to access NameCheap to get a free custom domain name.
        This whole project was totally free and I learned HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.
        If you are intrested in making your own static personal website watch this

        <a href = "https://github.com/scottydoesntknow4tran/scottydoesntknow4tran.github.io"> Code for this website</a> <br><br>

        Red-Black-Tree Data Structure Project: <br> <br>

        A tree data structure that rebalances "automatically" and allows O(log(n)) add, find, and remove operations that is faster than the AVL tree by using recurrsion and rebalancing the tree during the downward traversal. <br>
        <a href = "https://github.com/scottydoesntknow4tran/Red-Black-Trees"> RB Tree repository</a> <br> <br>

        Hash Table Data Structure Project:<br> <br>

        A data structure using a hash function to store data in a hash table that uses separate chaining to handle collisions and resizing the table to keep add, find, and remove operations to O(1). <br>

    <h3> <a name = "future"> What's next: </a> <br> </h3>
    <p>
       My goals for the immediate future are to learn as much as I can as a Software Engineer and figure out what I want to specialize in.
       I have done a decent ammount of back-end development in C++. I really enjoyed data structures, learning about how data a stored, retreived, and sorted efficently.
       I am currently learning front end development on my own. I am using tools such as HTML, PHP, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, Node.JS, ect. My next project is to create
       a dynamic website using that can log times spent in a gym and use the data to prefrom statical analysis to track progress, give updates, reminders, and reccomendations.
       I plan to start my career as a SWE, but with my knowledge of hardware systems I may be intrested in designing some products in the future. I am not truly set on any path
       at this point. I want to learn, gain expirence, and find what I am passionate about within the realm of computing.
