    <p>
        I am an computer engineer at Gonzaga University in Spokane, WA.<br>
        I love programming and working on anything that pushes the neeedle.<br>
        I have recently secured a SWE(software engineering) internship with The Home Depot for next summer<br>
        I have worked at The Home Depot for the last 2 years and enjoyed every part of it.

    </h3>
    <p>
        In highschool sports were a big part of my life and helped make me into the perseverant worker that I am today. I was a 3 sport varsity athelete in the 4A KingCo confrence, the hardest confrence in WA. 
        <br>I did football, baseball, wrestling, and track. I earned 9 scholar athelete awards for keeping my GPA above 3.5 while completing a sport season. This work in highschool has made me into a <br>
        person who will do anything for the team, and a competitor.<br>

    <h3>
        History with Computer Science:
    </h3>
    <p>
        My first expirence programming was in 8th grade. It was a few basic lessons in scratch and I quite enjoyed it. This led me to take Intro to CS and Intro to game desing freshman year of HS. <br>
        I explored more scratch and learned python.  Both of these classes were not challenging or intresting enough, so I did not take AP CS and did not look to learn more programming in HS.<br>

    <p>
        I have had 4 different jobs so far. In the past umpired baseball in highschool and worked at Target. <br>
        Currently I work at The Home Depot during breaks and TA while at school. Every job I have had has taught be something valuable. <br>

    <h3> <a name = "projects"> Projects: </a> <br> </h3>
    <p>
        I have completed a few different projects for school and for fun, including this one!<br> <br>

        This Project:<br> <br> 

        I set up a Github repository and used Github pages to host a static website. I used the Github student developer pack to access NameCheap to get a free custom domain name.
        This whole project was totally free and I learned HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.
        If you are intrested in making your own static personal website watch this

        <a href = "https://github.com/scottydoesntknow4tran/scottydoesntknow4tran.github.io"> Code for this website</a> <br><br>

        Red-Black-Tree Data Structure Project: <br> <br>

        A tree data structure that rebalances "automatically" and allows O(log(n)) add, find, and remove operations that is faster than the AVL tree by using recurrsion and rebalancing the tree during the downward traversal. <br>
        <a href = "https://github.com/scottydoesntknow4tran/Red-Black-Trees"> RB Tree repository</a> <br> <br>

        Hash Table Data Structure Project:<br> <br>

        A data structure using a hash function to store data in a hash table that uses separate chaining to handle collisions and resizing the table to keep add, find, and remove operations to O(1). <br>

    <h3> <a name = "future"> Future: </a> <br> </h3>
    <p>
       My goals for the immediate future are to learn as much as I can as a Software Engineer and figure out what I want to specialize in 
       I have done a decent ammount of back-end development in C++. I really enjoyed data structures, learning about how data a stored, retreived, and sorted efficently.
       I am currently learning front end development on my own. HTML, PHP, CSS, JavaScript, ect.
