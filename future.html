    <p>
       My goals for the immediate future are to learn as much as I can as a Software Engineer and figure out what I want to specialize in.
       I have done a decent ammount of back-end development in C++. I really enjoyed data structures, learning about how data a stored, retreived, and sorted efficently.
       I am currently learning front end development on my own. I am using tools such as HTML, PHP, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, Node.JS, ect. My next project is to create
       a dynamic website using that can log times spent in a gym and use the data to prefrom statical analysis to track progress, give updates, reminders, and reccomendations.
       I plan to start my career as a SWE, but with my knowledge of hardware systems I may be intrested in designing some products in the future. I am not truly set on any path
       at this point. I want to learn, gain expirence, and find what I am passionate about within the realm of computing.
